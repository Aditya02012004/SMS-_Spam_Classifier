# SMS-_Spam_Classifier

## Overview
This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that uses machine learning to detect and classify text messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The classifier is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages, and utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process the text before applying a machine learning algorithm for classification.

## Features
1. Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the SMS text for classification.
2. Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract features from text.
3. Classification Model: Implements a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines) to classify the messages.
4. Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the classifier consists of SMS messages that are labeled as either spam or ham.
